Object scaling with different UX in Unity with VR

 ### Scaling with button:
 Stand close to the object, point the controller to the object, the zoom UI should show up, then you can press the "+" and "-" button to scale the object. Move away your controller, the zoom UI will disappear in a few seconds

 ### Scaling with dragging two controllers 

 Grab the object by pressing the trigger on one controller. Hold the trigger on the other controller to active scaling, and scale the object by pulling away/moving close two controllers

 ### Scaling with joysticks

 Grab the object by holding the trigger, push up/down the joystick on the same controller to scale the object
